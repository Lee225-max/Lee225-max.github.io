I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Mathematics and Information Technology](https://www.eduhk.hk/mit/zhs/), [The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)](https://www.eduhk.hk/en/).Before joining EdUHK, I served as an Associate Professor (tenured) at the College of Management, Shenzhen University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK), following a master's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and a bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).



My research interests focus on `data science`, `business analytics`, and `intelligent optimization algorithms`, with particular emphasis on `mathematical modeling for complex systems `and `machine learning applications in combinatorial optimization`. I have developed innovative scheduling algorithms for healthcare systems, manufacturing processes, and logistics operations. My work has been published in top-tier journals including [Omega](), [Information Sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-sciences), [IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp), and [Artificial Intelligence in Medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com).



I am actively seeking motivated Ph.D. students, research assistants, and visiting scholars to join my research group. Prospective students with backgrounds in `mathematics`,` computer science`, or `education technology `are especially encouraged to apply. Interested candidates may contact me via email with `CV `and `research interests`. Due to the volume of inquiries, I may not be able to respond to all messages individually, but I carefully review each application.
